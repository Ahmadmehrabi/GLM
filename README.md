# GLM 
# Use of Gaussian linear model in cosmology

The Gaussian linear model provides a unique approach to obtain the posterior distribution as well as the Bayesian evidence analytically.
The GLM can be applied to the Hubble expansion rate data in LCDM, wCDM, or a non-flat LCDM models. 
In this repository, we provide a simple code to obtain the value of parameters that maximize the likelihood, posterior distribution and evidence.
